Have you felt this strange feeling?

You open the news, and the stock market is soaring to record highs. Companies are reporting huge profits. Everything looks green.

But then, you open LinkedIn or talk to your friends, and you hear a different story. "Massive layoffs at Amazon." "Accenture is cutting 11,000 jobs." "Microsoft, Nike, UPS... all laying people off."

It feels confusing, doesn't it? How can companies be doing so well, but so many people are losing their jobs?

For our parents' generation, the rule was simple: when a company made more money, it hired more people. Company growth meant job growth. They were connected, like a cart and its horse.

**For the first time in over twenty years, that connection is broken.**

If you look at the data, you can see it clearly. For decades, the S&P 500 (a measure of the stock market) and the number of job openings moved together. When one went up, the other went up.

Then, around the end of 2022, they split apart.

The stock market rocketed up, but job openings started to fall. That moment, by the way, is exactly when tools like ChatGPT were released to the world.

This has led to a new, scary reality: **A company's success no longer guarantees your job.**

The market is actually *cheering* for layoffs. Why? Because for every employee a company can replace with AI, its profits go up.


## A Perfect Example: The Amazon Layoffs

You don't have to look far. Just look at the news from **Amazon in late October 2025.**

The company announced it was cutting **14,000 corporate jobs**—about 4% of its white-collar workforce.

This wasn't because the company is failing. In fact, Amazon is performing very well and is extremely profitable. So why do it?

The official reason given by the CEO was "culture." He said the company grew too fast during the pandemic and created too many "layers" of management, which slowed things down. He wants the company to be "leaner" and "faster," like a startup.

But here is what you must understand: **what is *enabling* this "lean" new culture? It's AI.**

When you read the memos from other executives, the real picture becomes clear. They said this "new generation of AI" is "transformative" and requires the company to be "organized more leanly."

Here’s the simple truth:
1.  Amazon is cutting 14,000 "layers" of corporate and administrative jobs that can be automated or made more efficient with AI.
2.  The company is taking the billions of dollars saved from those salaries and redirecting it to... **investing even more in building AI and automation.**

Amazon is firing people *while* being profitable so it can spend more money on the very technology that allows it to fire those people. This is the "Great Disconnect" in action.


## Who Is Being Left Behind?

Here is the most painful part: this change is not hitting everyone equally.

You might think AI would replace the most basic, low-skill jobs first. But that's not what's happening. The first to be hit are the **juniors** and **entry-level employees.**

A Harvard study showed that companies using AI are cutting back on hiring new graduates and junior roles faster than anyone else.

Think about what this means. A career is like a ladder. You can't start at the top. You have to start on the first rung.

Those first-rung jobs—writing simple code, drafting documents, analyzing basic spreadsheets, designing a simple graphic—were how we all learned. It's how we gained the experience to climb to the second rung, and then the third.

But now, AI is very good at those "first-rung" tasks.

A company doesn't need five junior designers to brainstorm ideas; one senior designer with an AI tool can do it. They don't need ten junior analysts to process data; one senior analyst with an AI assistant can handle it.

So... if the first rungs of the ladder are removed, how does anyone ever start? How does the next generation build a career?


## This Is Not the Same as Before

Our elders will tell us, "We have been through this. The car replaced the horse-buggy. The tractor replaced the farmhand. We will adapt."

They are right, but this time is different for three big reasons:

1.  **Speed:** Past changes happened over decades. We had time to adapt, retrain, and for a new generation to learn new skills. This AI revolution is happening in *months and years*. It's moving too fast to catch our breath.
2.  **Scope:** Past machines came for our **muscle**. They did physical work. This new AI is coming for our **minds**. It's targeting "white-collar" cognitive work we thought was safe.
3.  **The Bottom-Up Effect:** As we just saw, this is the first time technology is "eating" the career ladder from the bottom up, making it hard for people to even get started.


## What Can We Do About It?

It is easy to feel scared or angry. And it's okay to feel that way. But after we feel it, we must act. We cannot complain and hope the world will stop changing.

If you are young, you have the most to lose, but you also have the most energy to adapt. Here is a simple plan.

### 1. Stop Being "Good." Be "Remarkable."

AI can be "good." It can write a "good" email or "good" code. In a world where "good" is instant and free, being "good" is no longer valuable.

You must become **remarkable**.

Focus on the things AI cannot do. AI cannot build a relationship with a client. It cannot manage a team and inspire them. It cannot understand the deep, unspoken *why* behind a project. It cannot combine two completely different ideas to create something new.

"Good" is replaceable. "Remarkable" is not.

### 2. Learn the Tool That Might Replace You

You cannot afford to ignore this. You must learn to use AI.

Spend time every week playing with the new tools. Use them to make your *current* work better and faster.

The person who refuses to learn AI will be replaced. The person who *uses* AI to become 10x more productive will be promoted. See it as an assistant, a partner, not an enemy.

### 3. Build Proof. Your Degree Is Not Enough.

In the new world, a college degree or a certificate matters less. Everyone has one.

What matters is **proof** that you can *build something real*.

This is why side projects are no longer a "nice-to-have." They are essential.
Build a simple app. Start a tiny newsletter. Create a project that solves a problem *you* have.

This small project is your proof. It proves you have discipline. It proves you can finish things. It proves you can create value from nothing. This is more valuable than any line on your resume.

### 4. "Comfortable" Is the New "Risky"

Staying at one company for a long time is fine *if* you are learning new things and taking on new challenges.

But if you are staying because it's "comfortable" and you are doing the same easy job you did three years ago... you are in the most dangerous position of all.

Stagnation is how you become replaceable. You must always be learning.

### 5. Work Hard Now, While You Can

This is not about "hustle culture" or burning yourself out. It's about reality.

If you are in your twenties, you have energy and time that you will never have again. This is the time to invest in yourself.

The extra hour you spend learning. The weekend you spend building your project. This is the work that will protect you and make you valuable for the next 10, 20, and 30 years. The people who will be secure in the future are the ones who built their foundation today.
